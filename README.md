A link list - a basic dynamic data structure in computer science, consisting of nodes, each of which contains both the actual data and one or two links ("bundles") to the
next and / or previous node in the list. A fundamental advantage over an array is its structural flexibility: the order of the elements of a linked list may not
coincide with the order of the data elements in the computer's memory, and the order of traversing the list is always explicitly specified by its internal links.
        
The program implements all the basic functions of a linked list.
